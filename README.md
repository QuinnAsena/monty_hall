# monty_hall
 A little R game I made one night of the monty hall problem when I couldn't sleep (nerrrrrd!).

Usually the problem consists of 3 doors and the simulation is run hundreds/thousands of times and the results plotted under conditions of 'switch choice' and 'stay'.
R code is readily available online to do that and I wanted to make a game that can be played with any number of doors with some fun visuals.
Took a lot more fiddling to make it work with any number of doors! I'm sure if I looked back through the code I could make it more efficient now....
